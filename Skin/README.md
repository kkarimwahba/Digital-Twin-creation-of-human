# Skin-Extraction-from-Image-and-Finding-Dominant-Color
Repository containing that code for the article Skin Segmentation and Dominant Tone/Color Extraction found at "https://medium.com/@mithushancj/skin-segmentation-and-dominant-tone-color-extraction-fe158d24badf". 

Project is an implementation of skin segmentation using OpenCV and dominant color extraction using SciKit-Learn. Read the article and notebook file of breakdown for the process.

## Getting Started
Provided you already have NumPy, SciKit-Learn, Matplotlib, OpenCV and imutils already installed clone the project and either run the python file or the notebook and run it locally.
